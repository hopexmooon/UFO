# UFO

Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to have the ability to filter and obtain specific information. We are analyzing UFO sightings, where they were sighted, what day it was, descriptors of the sighting, and the duration. We have added filters for any user to look up specific days, location, and shape of the UFOs. 


Results: 

The previous website only had one filter, City name. Adding five additional filters, UFO shape, location it was witnessed, will provide specificity. For example, filtering 1/13/2010 we see three different cities a UFO was spotted. If we wanted to filter down even further we can compare the UFO shape.

Filtering 1/1/2010 *and* searching for "light" UFO shape we can see several entries. This website can allow for various filters. Whether we want to compare dates among the same city/state or if we want to compare different sightings on the same night.

Summary: 

This is a great tool for UFO hunters to compare sightings however given the data size having state and city as a filter is redundant. There are not multiple city names from different states we need to distinguish. One recommendation would be to take out the state filter and instead add a a date filter. An extra terrestrial scientist would want to analyze UFO findings that took place during one day and see if there are any similarities. It would be interesting to see if a UFO sighting in California is similar to one in Kentucky that took place the same night. Another recommendation is to add pictures of some UFO sightings as well as distinguish between the different shapes. Some of the descriptors are vague, like "fireball" or "formation". Amateur scientists would greatly benefit from seeing a few examples to better identify between the different shapes.
