# UFO

Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to have the ability to filter and obtain specific information. We are analyzing UFO sightings, where they were sighted, what day it was, descriptors of the sighting, and the duration. We have added filters for any user to look up specific days, location, and shape of the UFOs. 


Results: 

The previous website only had one filter, City name. Adding two additional filters, UFO shape and state, will provide specificity. For example, 


Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 
Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Summary: 

This is a great tool for UFO hunters to compare sightings however given the data size having state and city as a filter is redundant. There are not multiple city names from different states we need to distinguish. One recommendation would be to take out the state filter and instead add a a date filter. An extra terrestrial scientist would want to analyze UFO findings that took place during one day and see if there are any similarities. It would be interesting to see if a UFO sighting in California is similar to one in Kentucky that took place the same night. Another recommendation is to add pictures of some UFO sightings as well as distinguish between the different shapes. Some of the descriptors are vague, like "fireball" or "formation". Amateur scientists would greatly benefit from seeing a few examples to better identify between the different shapes.
